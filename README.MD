Checkstyle
==========

# Reason
This repository is used to share one maven checkstyle settings file amongst
KNAW Digital Infrastructure teams. The idea is to share the configuration
settings for the different IDEs as well.

# Origin of checkstyle.xml
We are using a copy of https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/master/src/main/resources/google_checks.xml with a few adaptions to fit our preferences.
