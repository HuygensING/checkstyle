Checkstyle
==========

# Reason
This repository is used to share one maven checkstyle settings file within the HuygensING development team. The idea is to share the configuration settings for the different IDE's aswell.

# Origin of checkstyle.xml
We are using a copy of https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/master/src/main/resources/google_checks.xml with a few adaptions to fit our preferences.
